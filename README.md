## ![Week 3](Weekly_sessions/week3/week_3.ipynb "Go to code")
### Goals of week 3:
- [x] Learn how does a single neuron work
- [x] Learn how does a backpropagation algorithm work
- [x] Implement a simple neural network without frameworks
- [x] Train a network to solve the XOR problem

### XOR Problem

For solving a XOR problem the following structure of neural network was developed

![](images/6.png "Network")

It has 2 inputs, 1 hidden layer containing 2 neurons and 1 output neuron

### Backpropagation
The backpropagation algorithm consists of 3 steps:
1. forward
